# single-book-library
This script was made by me to review the content in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) at the end of [Chapter 5](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-03-method-syntax.html). This project was aimed to practice using structs and methods as well as to make a fun little script.

The implementation of the struct `Book` has 4 different fuctions to create a book, check out a book, return a book, and view a book's details. This way it is sort of similar to a simple one book library.

To use just use [rustc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/) or [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to build or run.

I hope you find this code and repository useful, thank you.
